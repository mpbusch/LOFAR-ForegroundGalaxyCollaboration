# LOFAR-ForegroundGalaxyCollaboration

Purpose: Codes are put here to compute scientific results for foregrounds galaxies for the LOFAR collaboration.

THE LOFAR Foreground Galaxy Collaboration aims to study nearby galaxies in with Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope in the Netherlands. This is an international collaboration between scientists at Arizona State University (ASU), University of Hamburg (U-Hamburg), and soon to be Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Projects:

We are currently studying M63 and M108, two galaxies that possess very different inclination angles which will allow us to do different science with both at low-frequencies. This is especially important with the new LOFAR FACET calibration (van Weeren et al. 2016) which allows for the deepest, highest resolution images at low-frequencies ever using direction-dependent calibration.
